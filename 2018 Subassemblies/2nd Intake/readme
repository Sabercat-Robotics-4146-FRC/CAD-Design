This was the Intake created for competition at AZ West. The following changes were made:
  - Smaller Banebot wheels used for top roller
  - Incorporated 3D printed parts for most of the design
  - Instead of a tray, a bottom roller was incorporated. 
  - Use of fiberglass shaft on bottom roller instead of aluminum
  - Top roller spring loaded with controlled hardstops
