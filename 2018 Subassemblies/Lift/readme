This was the cascading lift made for the 2018 season. It utilizes 3d printed bearing blocks to travel up and down rectangular tubing. 
It worked very well this season and the only alterations were:
  - Washers on either end of the holes on the end of the 3D printedbearing block to protect it from being chipped away. 
  - Changing the reduction on the motor from a 75:1 to a 108:1 at the AZ North competition.
 
 This subassembly also includes the Intake Pivot mechanism (with the 1st Iteration of the Intake), which kept the intake within our perimeter 
 at the beginning of the match and extended down during the match to pick up power cubes.
 It also helped us reach an extra 12" in height for climbing. 
 Alterations on the Intake Pivot
  - Changed it from being driven with a BAG motor to a Mini CIM motor
  - Overall reduction was the same, but instead of having a 300:1 reduction through a VersaPlanetary Gearbox
  we did a 108:1 reduction with an additional 3:1 reduction created through sprockets and chain outside of the gearbox.
  This was because our intake pivot broke in the finals of AZ West because we were using the versaplanetary gearboxes
  far past their intended rating of torque. 
  - Added pieces of angle to stiffen the assembly
